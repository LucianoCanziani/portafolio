This To-Do List was part of a technical interview in which I had 24 hours to complete it.

In it you can add, remove, edit and filter tasks as you like while seeing nice waves in the background.

I also added the quotable API so you can start the day with an inspiring message.

## How to use

1. Write a task in the entry and then press the "Add" button.
2. Check the completed task, edit or delete it.
3. You can filter tasks by completed and not completed.
