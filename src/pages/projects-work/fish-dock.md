Internal management platform for a fish exporter from the Caribbean to the United States. In it, they can control sales, manage the fish that enter until they leave the plant, invoice, and track the logistics until it reaches the customer.

## What I did do?

- Creation of QR codes that help update the stage the product is in the delivery to the client
- Creation of invoice documents for the products the buy to the boats and sell to clients.
- Fish reception in the plant and parts of the process in the production and packaging line.
- Emails notifications for clients with SendGrid

## This project is still ongoing
