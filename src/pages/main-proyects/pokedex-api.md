I decided to develop the Pokedex to improve my skills in handling large amounts of data in React Js.

## What did I learn in this project?

- Make API calls with "Axios" and then manipulate that data.
- Data filtering through search inputs by text and by options.
- Use "Pagination" when I have too many elements to place on one page and adjust the number of pages to them when filtered.
- Implement music and sound with "Howler".
- Some interesting CSS effects like the search bar.
